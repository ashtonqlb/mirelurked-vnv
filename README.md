### The Missing Setup Guide for Viva New Vegas on SteamOS 3

From the Via New Vegas FAQ section on Linux support.
> We cannot provide support for Linux as we don't use it, therefore we cannot troubleshoot issues specific to it.

This guide is a replacement for the 'Setup' and 'Mod Organizer 2' portions of the Viva New Vegas guide, written specifically for SteamOS 3 (Steam Deck, Legion Go S) handheld owners looking to enjoy the finest modded Fallout: New Vegas experience man has yet to imagine.
